# FourierVisualizer
Program which uses interconnected arrows rotating at different frequencies to draw out an image


A fourier series is a mathematical sum of wave frequencies which was proven by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier to be able to represent any closed, continuous function.
This program demonstrates visually and intuitively this exact property by taking in a closed outline of an image (i.e., the outline starts and ends at the same point), and converts it into a fourier series. This fourier series is represented by arrows connected tip-to-tail all rotating at different frequencies, with specified length and starting angle, which draw out the same image outline given.


Fourier series have many important applciations in technology, especially in transforming sound to signals which a computer can read and vice versa.
They are incredibly important to mathematics, especially in analyzing and solving differential equations using a method known as a fourier transform. This project uses a discrete fourier transform (using points rather than a given equation) to decompose a function into its frequencies.
